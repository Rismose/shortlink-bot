# How does it work? (for bypassing linkvertise?)
The bot sends a request to Linkvertise (https://publisher.linkvertise.com/api/v1/redirect/link/static/insert/linkvertise/path/here) and obtains the link id necessary to get the link.

Then, it sends another request to them (https://publisher.linkvertise.com/api/v1/redirect/link/insert/linkvertise/path/here/target?serial=base64encodedjson) to grab the link.

The linkvertise path is this part. (/respecting/linkvertise-bypass/)

An example of a serial is: 
`{"timestamp":1606260928, "random":"6548307", "link_id":31283553}`

The timestamp is the unix epoch, random isn't really random (always has to be 6548307) and link_id is the id we obtained from the first request.
